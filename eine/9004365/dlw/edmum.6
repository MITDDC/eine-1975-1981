>>> NEW HAIR FOR MULTIPLE WINDOW HACKING

> Two functions:
ED-SELECT-WINDOW takes a window, activates it, pulls it to the top, and deactivates
anything it covers up.  This is primarily good for mouse stuff.

ED-SELECT-WINDOWS takes a window and the REST of windows.  All of them become
the only active windows, and are all pulled to the top.

> Problem in that ED-RECURSE still wants to mung with ED-WINDOWS-DISPLAYED by itself;
so for now we have the Cant Hack Screen mode in effect for it (ED-WINDOW-HACKING-OK-P
bound to NIL.)


>>> USERS OF THE DEBUG STUFF:

>> Users of ed-debug-stream:
    ED-CREATE-LINE and -BUFFER (only in DEBUG mode)
    ED-INIT creates it
    ED-TOP-LEVEL binds print-default-output-dest to it
    ED-BARF uses it, and so does ED-COMMAND-EXECUTE

>> Users of ed-debug-pc-ppr:
    ED-INIT creates it, and uses it for debug-stream
    ED-RECOVER deactivates it
    ED-COMPLETE-REDISPLAY clears it
    ED-TOP-LEVEL binds console-io-pc-ppr to it
    ED-BARF uses it

>>> PROPOSAL

If ED-DEBUG-P is T, everything as it is now.

If ED-DEBUG-P is NIL, then (EQ ED-DEBUG-PC-PPR CONSOLE-IO-PC-PPR) and
   (EQ ED-DEBUG-STREAM (FUNCTION CONSOLE-IO))

>> Problems?

Flush CREATE hacks!
ED-INIT hair!!
ED-BARF, if (NOT ED-DEBUG-P) will have to SCREEN-MUNGED.
ED-RECOVER care.
ED-COMPLETE-REDISPLAY should only clear if ED-DEBUG-P
