Abstract
.fi b

     ZWEI is a real-time display-oriented editor, written for the Lisp Machine.
It is display-oriented in that the text being edited is displayed on the screen
at all times; it is real-time in that commands are executed as soon as they are
given.  The result is an extremely interactive and efficient kind of editing.
This kind of editor has become very popular in widespread parts of the MIT
computer community, and has been found to be easy to use yet extremely powerful.
This thesis describes the user interface presented by ZWEI, and explains
how ZWEI was implemented.  An emphasis is placed on the way the nature of the
Lisp Machine system affected ZWEI's design.

     I would like to express my appreciation and thanks to:

The rest of the "Emacs-Like Editor Writers of America": Ted Anderson (SINE),
Bernie Greenberg (Multics EMACS), and Richard Stallman (ITS EMACS);

Richard Greenblatt, for starting me off on the A.I. Lab, the Lisp Machine
project, and this editor;

Dave Moon, who taught me a great deal of what I know about programming
and with whom I spent countless hours working on Lisp Machine software
and documentation;

Mike McMahon, Richard Stallman, and the rest of the Lisp Machine group
for writing parts of EINE and ZWEI and for their suggestions, discussions,
and good ideas;

Ted Anderson, for TINT's not being TECO and SINE's not being EINE;

and finally to all the members of the Student Information Processing
Board, for the endless friendship and moral support that made my
stay at MIT so pleasant and rewarding.
